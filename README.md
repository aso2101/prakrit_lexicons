# Prakrit Lexicons

This repository contains data from two premodern Prakrit lexicons:

1. Hēmacandra’s *Dēśīnāmamālā* (*Garland of Regional Nouns*), composed in the middle of the twelfth century, which lists so-called *dēśī* words alphabetically and offers Prakrit equivalents (as well as Sanskrit equivalents in his own commentary).
2. Dhanapāla’s *Pāiyalacchī* (*Prakrit Lakṣmī*), composed in Dhārā in 972 for the poet’s sister. It is organized into topical sections, and is a short Amarakōśa for Prakrit.

I plan to add Trivikrama’s list of *dēśī* words at somepoint in the future.

## Further information

Right now the *Dēśīnāmamālā* is presented in TEI format.
